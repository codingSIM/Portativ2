# Portativ 2
I created Portativ 2 as a means to measure how much I could improve 
from the first iteration of the project. My aim for this project was 
to create a tool that I could use to make songs and sound effects for 
future projects.

# Features
1. Firstly the program features a simple animated keyboard at the top of the screen. 
1. When a note passes the player head (positioned under the keys), the corresponding key will light up. 
1. On top of every set of octave keys there are buttons which transpose the octave higher or lower. 
1.On the left side there is a menu which can be accessed by clicking:
   1. [H] Hide - Hides the keyboard graphics
   2. [M] Mode - Changes the mode of the notes (between sine, triangle, sawtooth, square)
   3. [Space] Play - Play/Pause the notes
   4. [R] Reset - Reset notes to the highest placed note in the array
   5. [S] Save - Save the note array as a txt file 
   6. [L] Load - Asks you to upload a screenNotes.txt file
   7. [Click] Record: 
      1. 1st press = starts recording
      1. 2nd press = stops recording
      1. 3rd press = saves recording (.wav)
   8. [I] Info - Shows information about the menu
1. Unlisted keys: 
   1. [C] - Pressing C clears all notes
   2. [D] - Enter/Exit delete mode (click on notes to delete)
   3. [Scrolling] - moves notes up or down
   4. [F] - Toggle Fullscreen
1. Portativ 2 allows the user to export (save) and import (load) older saves / iterations of their musical project. 
1. The user can also record the music using the record button and save it as a .wav file on their machine.

# Future improvements
This project was not made with responsiveness in mind, thus it will not resize for different screens. This will be taken into consideration in the next possible update. Portativ 2 would also benefit from a using nicer graphics, currently it looks more like a test-build rather than a finished project. I plan to add better graphics in a future update.
